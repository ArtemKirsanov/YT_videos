# Elegant Geometry of Neural Computations
Dynamical systems in Neuroscience. Part III


- `Animations.py` – a collection for functions to create separate animations (e.g. for the phase plane, the time evolution of the system, nullclines etc.)
- `NeuronModel.py` – a class that represents a simple 2-variable (voltage and n-gates) neuron model. The model has 4 preconfigured sets of parameters to showcase 4 different bifurcations.
- `create_scenes.py` – a collection of functions to create individual scenes for the video. For a specific scene, uncomment the corresponding function call in the `main` function.
- `manim_water_landscape.ipynb` a notebook with creating a "flowing" streamlines animation in manim.
